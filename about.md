My name is Parham Doustdar. In the morning, I work at Booking.com, leading a team of amazing and talented developers to create [Shipper](https://github.com/bookingcom/shipper).

Atnight, I coach people to allow themselves to dream bigger, and to
turn their dreams into reality. Click [here ](/coaching/) if you're
interested in a free session where we get to know each other and
explore if we can work together.
