My name is Parham Doustdar. I am a PHP programmer who is taking baby steps to become an entrepreneur.

This blog is my attempt at:

1. Forcing myself to write
2. Sharing my journey through the world of PHP and entrepreneurship
3. Ultimately, getting to know the wonderful people living on this earth â€“ [you are the company you keep](http://www.letgodbetrue.com/proverbs/commentaries/13_20.php)

Okay. I've never quoted a proverb in my entire life. I suppose that shows the importance of the last item for me.
