I am a back-end developer that keeps up-to-date with the latest emerging technologies and best practices. These include new languages, PHP frameworks, design and architectural patterns, and tools.

I have always striven to write awesome code, have strong communication with my peers and managers/leaders, and that has resulted in me having lots of steadfast friends everywhere I&#39;ve worked. Despite my age and my country, I&#39;ve always tried to reach beyond borders and my dream has been to touch the lives of my fellow humans in a positive way.

I hope to use my skills to make the world a wonderful place; even better than it already is!

##Education

**Associates**, Western Tehran Azad Islamic University, *2008 – 2010*

visual-basic, .net, php, postgresql, operating-system, vbscript

Although there is a lot of discrimination going in Iran against the disabled, and the studying conditions are very poor, I achieved a 20 (in Iran, grades are calculated out of 20; that means I got a 100) in every programming-related course. The only courses I didn&#39;t get a 20 in were the ones that required illustrating graphs and structures that I obviously can&#39;t do, as I&#39;m blind.

And the great thing is, I never studied. I couldn&#39;t, because I didn&#39;t have books in a format available to the blind. All of the grades I got, adding up to a GPA of 17.31 out of 20, were achieved by things I myself knew. I learned nothing new in the university, and that&#39;s why I quit academic studies after this degree.

## Tools

**First Computer:** Intel Pentium 166 MHz desktop CPU

## Background

I&#39;m a completely blind programmer that got to learn programming with no books in his first language, Farsi. I learned programming by reading books from wonderful authors, and getting to know them through their books as my mentors.

From the first day I went to work, I was regarded as a senior programmer, due to the knowledge I had gathered while playing around at home. Since I like meeting new people, getting to know them, and learn from them. I began learning from anyone who knew something more than me, and quickly drew myself up to be regarded as a programmer that delivers high-quality work that allows everyone to sleep easy at night.
