I'm currently a manager and back-end developer working in Booking.com core infrastructure as part of the team developing [Shipper](https://github.com/bookingcom/shipper).

At work, I help our team feel better, be more productive and grow. I'm a manager since February of 2019, so I have a lot to learn.

At home, I play the piano, read books on psychology and management, and try out different kinds of food with my wife, Bita.

## Experience

**Team Lead & Developer**, Booking.com, *September 2016 – Current*

- I've been a team lead and member in the team that came up with and created [Shipper](https://github.com/bookingcom/shipper), which is Booking.com's open-source project to make rolling out a multi-cluster application on Kubernetes an enjoyable experience.

**PHP Programmer**, TENA, *April 2014 – July 2016*

phalcon, phpunit, codeception, vagrant, liquibase, zabbix, mockery, go, java, android, redis, puppet

- I mentored my fellow developers and kept them motivated. One developer went on to become a vice-president of in his next job, and another went on to become a skilled front-end developer with a career
- I rewrote the company's legacy code, reducing bugs to zero and making the software maintainable. This allowed new features to be added a lot faster, and allowed business owners to gather data on metrics they had no visibility into before.
- I introduced unit testing to the business, setting a standard of above 95% and sticking to it. This drastically lowered the number of regressions in our software.
- I introduced a service-oriented architecture to promote high-availability clusters, easier scaling of services, and making applications manageable.
- I helped our devOps team manage micro-services through writing automated Puppet scripts.
- I wrote a superfast web server for a software the company had purchased, with built-in load balancing, queuing, and recovery mechanism. I did this with Go and Redis.
- I created a simple Android application so that our customers would be able to open our website in their mobile phones.

## Background

I'm a completely blind manager. I began as a developerthat got to
learn programming with no books in his first language, Farsi. I
learned programming by reading books from wonderful authors, and
getting to know them through their books as my mentors.

From the first day I went to work, I was regarded as a senior
programmer, due to the knowledge I had gathered while playing around
at home. Since I like meeting new people, getting to know them, and
learn from them, I began learning from anyone who knew something more
than me, and quickly drew myself up to be regarded as a programmer
that delivers high-quality work that allows everyone to sleep easy at
night.

In 2016, I was hired by Booking.com, where i had the experience of
being surrounded by people who knew a lot more than I did. After
working my way through the initial confusions of being the one and
only developer who was completely blind, I started managing the
Shipper team in the February of 2019.
