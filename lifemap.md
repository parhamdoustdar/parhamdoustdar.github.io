# Mission [far in the future]

I want to foster a community where people grow and thrive

In order to create a world of courageous, grounded, and connected individuals


# Vision [about 1 year in the future]

It’s Saturday, May 10, 2025. I and Bita are getting ready for our
goodbye party tonight, and we are feeling anxious and excited at once!

We are leaving in a few days to Malta to begin the next stage
of our lives. We have our money invested to generate most of our
living costs. We also have cash on hand to fill up the gaps if we need
to. My business is slowly growing, but I'm not worried any more – I
work on it to advance my mission, not to get money to live.
